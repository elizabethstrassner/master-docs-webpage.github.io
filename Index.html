<p> CHICAGO — At a time when many schools are cutting arts programs to save money, the success of Chicago’s Yollocalli Arts Reach, now celebrating its 20th anniversary, illustrates the importance of providing young people with a creative outlet. </p>
<p> Yollicalli, the youth initiative of the National Museum of Mexican Art (NMMA), provides free arts programming to adolescents in the Little Village and Pilsen neighborhoods. “Youth art programs are important because they provide a space for teens to explore their creativity, meet other young people, and be exposed to new opportunities,” said program director Vanessa Sanchez. </p>
<p> Since its founding in 1997, the program has received significant recognition in the philanthropic community. In 2009, Yollocalli was honored by the President’s Committee on the Arts and Humanities with a National Arts and Humanities Youth Programs Award; in 2008, Sanchez was profiled in the Chicago Sun-Times feature “50 People Who Make Chicago a Better Place” for her work with the program.

<p> Course offerings this summer include Camera Flux, a video storytelling course, and Street Art Studio, a mural class that includes lessons on the history of graffiti. </p>
<p> “I honestly feel that Yollocalli gives the students a home to embrace their artistic side,” said student and radio producer Gerardo Salgado, 20. “They reach for their students’ full potential.” </p>
<p> Salgado’s own experiences at Yollocalli have included a trip to a Latin music festival in Mexico City, about which he created a radio special for the Wattz up! radio show on 105.5 FM. “I recorded, produced, and edited a 2-hour special all by myself,” Salgado said. “I don’t think I would have done it without the classes and helpful guidance from my teacher.” Other students have also gotten the opportunity to share their work with a wider audience — a “Best of Yollo 2017” art exhibition is on display at the NMMA through August 13.  </p>
<p> Recognition and acclaim may have come to Yollocalli in its 20 years of existence, but its ultimate purpose is still best summarized by its name, which comes from the Nahuatl words for “house” and “heart.” </p>

<p>“So many of the teens call Yollocalli their home,” Sanchez said. “We are proud to provide them with a space they feel at home in.” </p>
